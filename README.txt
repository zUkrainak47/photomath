somewhat big project to create a program which solves some math problems.
algebra.py contains every program and therefore can solve all of the problems.
every problem solving sub-program is located in the res folder, 
changes to them may have been made in the algebra.py file.

edit: this is a collab with a classmate (Volodymyr Lazor). he made the Horner's scheme calculator whereas i made the calculator for binomials.
